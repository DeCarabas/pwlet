This is a small password generator; it generates relatively secure
passwords for websites and other situations where you do not trust the
site to keep the password secure. It works as follows: 

1. You give it a master password, which it keeps as a secret.

2. You give it the name of the site or thing you want a password
   for. The important thing here is that you remember how you picked
   the name of the site. (e.g., you might decide that you will always
   remove 'www.', so 'www.github.com' becomes 'github.com'.)

3. It concatenates those two strings with a ':', encodes them in
   UTF-8, computes the MD5 hash of that byte array, and then converts
   that byte array to a lowercase hexadecimal representation. (e.g.,
   the bytes [B5 C4 9A] would become the string "b5c49a".)

4. It puts that string on the clipboard, so it can be pasted into
   whatever wants the password.

That's it! A new password for each site.

Why MD5? Why hex, not base64 or some other thing? Honestly, it's
because there was a web page (http://angel.net/~nic/passwd.html) that
did this first, and this is the scheme they used. By the time I got
around to writing my own program for this, I had already made enough
passwords that I just wanted 100% compatibility. The scheme could be
made more secure, but I'm not trying to foil serious attackers, I'm
just trying to foil random kiddies. (And I honestly don't actually
understand the real vulnerabilities against this sort of thing.)
