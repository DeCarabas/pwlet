# Passwordlet

This is a small password generator; it generates relatively secure passwords
for websites and other situations where you do not trust the site to keep the
password secure. It works as follows:

  1. You give it a master password, which it keeps as a secret.

  2. You give it the name of the site or thing you want a password for. The
     important thing here is that you remember how you picked the name of the
     site. (e.g., you might decide that you will always remove 'www.', so
     'www.github.com' becomes 'github.com'.)

  3. It concatenates those two strings with a ':', and then hashes them to
     generate a password.

  4. It puts that string on the clipboard, so it can be pasted into
     whatever wants the password.

That's it! A new password for each site.

## Algorithm Details

There are two version of the generation algorithm, an old one, and the current
one.

The current one is:

  1. Concatenate the master password, a ':', and the site name.
  2. Get the UTF-8 encoding of the concatenated string.
  3. Hash the UTF-8 encoding with SHA256.
  4. Convert the hash to a Base64 string
  5. Append an upper-case letter, generated by computing 'A' + (data[0] % 26)
  6. Append a lower-case letter, generated by computing 'a' + (data[1] % 26)
  7. Append a digit, generated by computing '0' + (data[2] % 10)
  8. Append an exclamation point. ('!')

This one generates long passwords with all typable symbol types, which is more
likely to make it past password complexity guardians.

The old one is the one implemented by http://angel.net/~nic/passwd.html, and
is as follows:

  1. Concatenate the master password, a ':', and the site name.
  2. Get the UTF-8 encoding of the concatenated string.
  3. Hash the UTF-8 encoding with MD5.
  4. Convert the hash to a string of hex digits, using lower-case letters.

This does not generate long passwords, and they tend to fail arbitrary
complexity monitors. (The only advantage is that the passwords are possible to
memorize, so you don't always have to go back to the generator, and you can
use the generated passwords in places without copy-paste.)
